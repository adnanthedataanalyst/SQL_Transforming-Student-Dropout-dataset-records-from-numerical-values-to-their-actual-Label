# SQL_Student-Dropout

Student's Dropout Prediction: Unveiling Categorical Labels through SQL Queries"
A Data science project on Predicting Students' dropout using SQL queries for data analysis and transformation.
Introduction
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model using SQL queries to identify students who are likely to drop out. By utilizing data on student demographics, academic performance, socio-economic factors, and other relevant variables, the goal is to build a robust predictive model that can effectively forecast the likelihood of students dropping out.

The data gathered is from both internal and external sources, extracted from various databases within universities and colleges. It covers student records spanning from the academic year 2008/2009 to 2018/2019.

This model can then be used by educational institutions to allocate resources, implement early intervention strategies, and support at-risk students.

## Problem
In the dataset, a significant issue has emerged – all the categorical columns are encoded, and there is a lack of crucial information about what each numerical label represents.

### Here is a sample of the dataset:
As you see, the number each column does not mean anything. For example, in the Marital Status, we do not know what 1 and 2 mean.

| Marital status | Application mode | Application order | Course | ... | Unemployment rate | Inflation rate | GDP | Target  |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|-----|-------------------|-----------------|-----|---------|
| 1               | 8                 | 5                 | 2      | ... | 10.8              | 1.4             | 1.74| Dropout |
| 1               | 6                 | 1                 | 11     | ... | 13.9              | -0.3            | 0.79| Graduate|
| 1               | 1                 | 5                 | 5      | ... | 10.8              | 1.4             | 1.74| Dropout |
| 1               | 8                 | 2                 | 15     | ... | 9.4               | -0.8            | -3.12| Graduate|
| 2               | 12                | 1                 | 3      | ... | 13.9              | -0.3            | 0.79| Graduate|
| 2               | 12                | 1                 | 17     | ... | 16.2              | 0.3             | -0.92| Graduate|
| 1               | 1                 | 12                | 1      | ... | 15.5              | 2.8             | -4.06| Graduate|
| 1               | 9                 | 4                 | 11     | ... | 15.5              | 2.8             | -4.06| Dropout |
| 1               | 1                 | 3                 | 10     | ... | 16.2              | 0.3             | -0.92| Graduate|

## Solution:

To address this problem, a potential solution is to refer to the coding scheme of the dataset that provides information for the categorical values. The dataset available at [this link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success) can be used for this purpose. It likely contains the missing information about the categorical labels used in the provided dataset.

To incorporate this information into the existing dataset, SQL queries can be employed to join the two datasets on relevant columns and update the categorical values with their corresponding labels. This will enhance the interpretability of the data and enable a more meaningful analysis.

Certainly! Here's the table with the line breaks removed and categories explained as one above the other:
