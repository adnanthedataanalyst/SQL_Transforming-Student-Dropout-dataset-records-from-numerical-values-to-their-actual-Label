# SQL_Student-Dropout

Student's Dropout Prediction: Unveiling Categorical Labels through SQL Queries"
A Data science project on Predicting Students' dropout using SQL queries for data analysis and transformation.
Introduction
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model using SQL queries to identify students who are likely to drop out. By utilizing data on student demographics, academic performance, socio-economic factors, and other relevant variables, the goal is to build a robust predictive model that can effectively forecast the likelihood of students dropping out.

The data gathered is from both internal and external sources, extracted from various databases within universities and colleges. It covers student records spanning from the academic year 2008/2009 to 2018/2019.

This model can then be used by educational institutions to allocate resources, implement early intervention strategies, and support at-risk students.

## Problem
In the dataset, a significant issue has emerged â€“ all the categorical columns are encoded, and there is a lack of crucial information about what each numerical label represents.

### Here is a sample of the dataset:
As you see, the number each column does not mean anything. For example, in the Marital Status, we do not know what 1 and 2 mean.

| Marital status | Application mode | Application order | Course | ... | Unemployment rate | Inflation rate | GDP | Target  |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|-----|-------------------|-----------------|-----|---------|
| 1               | 8                 | 5                 | 2      | ... | 10.8              | 1.4             | 1.74| Dropout |
| 1               | 6                 | 1                 | 11     | ... | 13.9              | -0.3            | 0.79| Graduate|

| 1               | 8                 | 2                 | 15     | ... | 9.4               | -0.8            | -3.12| Graduate|
| 2               | 12                | 1                 | 3      | ... | 13.9              | -0.3            | 0.79| Graduate|
| 2               | 12                | 1                 | 17     | ... | 16.2              | 0.3             | -0.92| Graduate|

## Methodology Approach
The approach undertaken in this project comprises the following steps:

1. **Data Collection:** Utilizing Kaggle datasets to gather relevant information.
2. **Code Description Integration:** Incorporating coding scheme details from Damiieibikun's GitHub repository, accessible [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success). This repository likely holds the missing information concerning the categorical labels used in the provided dataset.
3. **SQL Integration:** To enhance interpretability and facilitate a more meaningful analysis, SQL queries will be employed to merge the datasets based on relevant columns. This process involves updating the categorical values in the existing dataset with their corresponding labels, ensuring a comprehensive and well-understood dataset for analysis.

Here are the SQL Queries
```sql

-- 6. Creating a new column for analysis

-- Step 3: Checking Target and Dropout columns
-- In this step, I am inspecting the "Target" column and the newly created "Dropout" column.
-- If the results are correct, the "Dropout" column should show 'Yes' when the record indicates 'Dropout' in the "Target" column, and 'No' otherwise.
SELECT [Target], [DropoutCode]
FROM [StuDrop].[dbo].[dataset]

-- Step 4: For analysis purposes, I need to create a new column named Dropout where Yes changes to 1 and No changes to 0.
